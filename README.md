## FrontEndProject
### Struggles
- Have a hard time moving data from page one to two
- Centering the map after getting two locations
- Getting the zoom to be correct according to distance
- route directions
- embeded video inside front page
- Used Zomato's API to link the users data to search for
- our data is based on Zomato's API and it doesn't include all.


### Things to Improve
- remove the setimeOut function when using geocoder
- better scoping order
